# monkey-go

This repository contains code for a parser for the `Monkey language` implemented
in Go. The parser is based on the book
[Writing an interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com) by Thorsten Ball.

## Running tests

There are several tests available. Run either of the below commands to run the
test suite for the parser and lexer, respectively:

```sh
go run ./parser
go run ./lexer
```
